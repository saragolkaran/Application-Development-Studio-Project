#### Good Points

1.  The differen events are presented in different colours. The title of the event were also included at the side of the webpage. User can just select from there as well.
2. The ui of the calendar is neat and is not confusing for user to see.

#### Bad Points

1. It will be better to include timeline either at the side or on top so that user can know the duration of the event such as the start time and end time.
2. The calendar does not have a filter to filter either week or month. It will be easier for user to see their events as well.
