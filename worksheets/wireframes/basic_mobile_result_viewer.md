#### Good Points

1. The ui of the schedule table is nice.
2. The time is also being displayed which makes it more easy for users to plan their schedule properly

#### Bad Points

1. There too much information on the mobile page. It is not neccessary to include the all the months on the same page
as it can be too messy. 
2. Too many informations are being cramped together as well \.

#### Good Points

1. The ui of the event schedule is nice and attractive
2. It is clear for users to see as every event uses different colour to represent it. 
3. Time is included as well which is better for users to take not of the schedule istead of typing it the time
manually out. 

#### Bad Points

1. It may be hard to code out and implement this event schedule table out.
